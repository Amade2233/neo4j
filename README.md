# Graph Database Demo using my Linkedin Connections 

A graph database is a database designed to treat the relationships between data as equally important to the data itself. 
It is intended to hold data without constricting it to a pre-defined model showing how each individual entity connects with or is related to others.
Neo4j graph database is mostly used to solve a business problem (e.g., fraud detection, social network etc.). 
This demostration will show;
1. Communication and clarity .
2. High Level of graph database developed in terms of nodes, relationships, meta data associated with 
nodes etc
3. Depth of demonstration using social network context (Linkedin)
